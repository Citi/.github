##  ‚öñÔ∏è Code of Conduct

Citi has adopted a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Citi/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) (v2.0). To report any inappropriate behavior or for any questions related to our Code of Conduct, please contact opensource@citi.com.

##  ‚úçÔ∏è DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)

Open source projects are commonly distributed under an [open source license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). Any contribution to a project with a license is subsequently licensed under the same terms. Typically, you can find the license for a project at the root of the repository under `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`.

To accept the terms of a project's license and for us to accept your contribution, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](/DCO.md) on *each contribution* (referred to as per-commit sign-off).

To agree to the DCO, simply add the `-s` flag each time you create a commit:

```bash
$ git commit -s ...
```
To sign-off historical commits missing a signature, you can run:

```bash
$ git rebase --signoff HEAD~4 // ‚ÑπÔ∏è Add sign-off on the last 4 commits...
```

You can verify that you have successfully signed a commit:

```bash
$ git log

commit 816e57945c8f4f15b0bbd27e088b7d2bd74df34b
